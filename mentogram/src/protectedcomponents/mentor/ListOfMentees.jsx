// this function is going to use the mentees array in the database under the mentor and render the mentees in a list with a TO-DO lsit like
// fashion. There will be tiny dustbins as delete buttons. There will be a button to add mentees. Which will redirect the mentor to the
// AddMentees.jsx. There will also be a button on each mentee to "Connect mentee". This will redirect the mentor to the collaborative coding
// /chat/videochat/filemanager page.
